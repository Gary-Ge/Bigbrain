### 1. Always Visible Navbar
The navigation bar is always at the top of the screen, no matter what scrolling you do on the screen. Make sure you can easily navigate to other pages (such as home page, join game page, etc.) without retyping the url or using the back key
### 2. Autosave in Game Editing
When editing the game, all the modifications you did would be auto saved after you unblurred that textfield/checkbox. You don't need to worry about losing your work by closing the page by mistake.
### 3. Input Check and Prompt Text
For most of the editable field, we provided input check and prompt text to tell you what kind of format/value/text is acceptable, make your editing more easily.
### 4. Game Check
When you want to finish editing or start a game, we will perform a game check to ensure that the game is valid. We will check if all the required field is finished. The game cannot be started if it is incompleted, preventing you from starting a half-finished game.
